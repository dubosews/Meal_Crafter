# Meal Crafter

## About Our Product
Our app, Meal Crafter, is a 5-day meal planner. This app allows for the consumer to not only discover new meals, but also provide them with a list of ingredients to help make shopping easier and quicker. Meal crafter allows for the consumer to plan out their meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The app not only provides the consumer with the ingredients, type of meal, and type of cuisine. We hope that the Meal Crafter allows for our consumers to be less stressed when it comes to weekly meal prepping. The Meal Crafter is not only just for meal preppers, but also is for the everyday foodie who wants to experiment and try new cuisines.

## Purpose
Meal Crafter is a 5 day meal planner with ingredients for any consumer. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, TheMealDB API, and HTML Drag and Drop API to create this website. We started with a basic wireframe to create the layout of the website. We used the wireframe along with Tailwind CSS to create the basic HTML outline for our website. After using Tailwind CSS to format the HTML, we started to code the JavaScript with the help of TheMealDB API and HTML Drag and Drop API. The APIs allows our consumer to find a random meal and drag and drop it to the specific meal time and weekday that they want to cook the meal on. Additionally, we have added the function of local storage, so that the consumer can always come back and look at the meal plan they created.
